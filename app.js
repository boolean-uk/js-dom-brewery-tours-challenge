// ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
// 1. Connect to Open Brewery DB using Insomnia to figure out how to get the data
// 2. Add an event listener to the search button that:
// 3.  – Calls a function that imports relevant brewery data into local state based on state entered into search
// 4.  – And removes everything other than "Micro", "Regional" or "Brewpub"
// 5.  – Calls another function that renders the page from the local state as found in "standard-list-items.html"
// 6. Add an event listener to the filter dropdown that:
// 7.  – Calls a function that filters the state into another variable accordingly
// 8.  – Calls the render function
// 
// EXTENSION #1:
// 1. Add search section to index.html
// 2. Add event listener to each keyboard stroke in the input field that:
// 3.  – Calls a function that filters the state into another variable accordingly
// 4.  – Calls the render function
//
// EXTENSION #2:
// 1. Add cities outline into index.html
// 2. For each city, create a new tickbox in JS with its own event listener that: 
// 3.  – Calls a function that filters the state into another variable accordingly
// 4.  – Calls the render function
// 5. Add clear all button that re-runs the for each in point #2 (hopefully this will work)
//
// EXTENSION #3:
// 1. No idea about the pagination yet. Maybe filter and display breweries by index?
//
// EXTENSION #4:
// 1. If I ever get here, do something similar to the to-do-list...?
